#------------------------------------
#Variables
#------------------------------------

# c_aq is a list ([1,2,3,4,5...]) filled with the
# infomation collected in the last months of everyday's
# air quality in the selected city

# c_aqm is the median from all these values organized from
# lowest to highest

# c_aqp is the sum of the lowest value from the list, the
# highest value, and the median, divided by three

# The median is needed for knowing if there are more high
# values than low values, and giving a more accurate
# average
